# The Acropolis Journey - Story

## Part 0: Where It All Begins

The player wakes up in a bed, somewhere in Athens. It is a small house and it has one window from which somebody can look at the Acropolis (at the top of a mountain).

The player *has* to look in the direction of the Acropolis, then the first chapter starts.

## Part 1: We need to go there

After looking at the Acropolis (see end of part 0), a door will be opened somewhere in the room.

The player has to go outside for the story to continue, however, looking around in the house might be quite handy since there are some clues hidden in the house.

After going outside, the only option the player has is to follow the streets up the hill.

On the way, the player will encounter his first clue.

When the player walked a bit further, the second chapter starts.
